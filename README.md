# StatisticalComputingFinalProject
# Hello and welcome to my final project for statistical computing where I was asked to create a multiple linear regression model that predicts a winner in a head-to-head matchup.
# Note this is a project that I wrote code that is to be ran in R, so you cannot use my function/wrapper unless you use R.
# The zip file that can be found in this Github respository carries the dataset that needs to be utilized, the R file that carries the function I created, as well as another readme file that will explain how to upload that dataset and R file into R, and it also explains how to use the function.
# Have Fun using my project!
